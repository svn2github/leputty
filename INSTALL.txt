LePutty

instructions for installing


first, install LePutty the same way you would install Putty
see http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/ for details

then, you can unzip the lrsz package that is included in the binary
archive, so that you can point to lz.exe and rz.exe in LePutty's
configuration box (so that zmodem transfer works).

For any other problems please refer to LePutty's home page at
http://leputty.sourceforge.net
