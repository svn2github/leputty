merged from Putty. Mostly crashes.
option for CJK handling.
Annoying refresh should be fixed.

01/31/2005
merged main Putty trunk in ; among other things:
* Support for falling back through the list of addresses returned from
a DNS lookup, whether they're IPv4, v6 or a mixture of both.
* Add a configuration option for TCP keepalives (SO_KEEPALIVE), default off.
No very good reason, but I've occasionally wanted to frob it to see if it
makes any difference to problems I'm having, and it was easy.
* Allow reconfiguration of compression and cipher settings in
mid-session in SSH2: this forces an immediate rekey to activate the
new settings. I'm not sure exactly what this will be useful for
* Support reconfiguration of key exchange in mid-session
* SSH port forwarding is now configurable in mid-session. After doing
Change Settings, the port forwarding setup function is run again,
and tags all existing port forwardings as `do not keep'. Then it
iterates through the config in the normal way; when it encounters a
port forwarding which is already in the tree, it tags it `keep'
rather than setting it up from scratch. Finally, it goes through the
tree and removes any that haven't been labelled `keep'. Hence,
editing the list of forwardings in Change Settings has the effect of
cancelling any forwardings you remove, and adding any new ones.
The SSH panel now appears in the reconfig box, and is empty apart
from a message explaining that it has to be there for subpanels of
it to exist. Better wording for this message would be welcome.

* fix serious security hole which can allow a server to execute code of its choice on a PuTTY client connecting to it. In SSH2, the attack can be performed before host key verification, meaning that even if you trust the server you think you are connecting to, a different machine could be impersonating it and could launch the attack before you could tell the difference. We recommend everybody upgrade to 0.56 as soon as possible.
* general fixes from Putty
* Support the SSH-2 mechanism for sending signals to a running session
* ability not to run a remote shell/command at all
* lots of changes for unicode
* new code for handling history
09/24/2004
* Malcolm Smith's patch to support CHAP (digest-based) authentication
when talking to SOCKS 5 proxies. Configures itself transparently (if
the proxy offers CHAP it will use it, otherwise it falls back to
ordinary cleartext passwords).
* `ampersat-in-username': tweak `strchr' to `strrchr' where necessary to
consistently support usernames containing `@'.
